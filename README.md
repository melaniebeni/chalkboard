#### What I Learned

From this project I have learned how to pull together website requirements into a cohesive sitemap and wireframe as a first step to building a website. I learned how to make all the different pages connect to each other and not have any deadends and not to rely on a back button when linking through multiple pages. I also learned that creating a wireframe can get confusing if you keep going back and forth from page to page, and it's helpful to just go page by page starting from the top following the sitemap.I first drew up the sitemap based on the written requirements then followed the sitemap to create the wireframe.
